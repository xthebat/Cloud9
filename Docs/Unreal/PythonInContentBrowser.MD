# Enable Python Content Browser Integration

By default, the only method to run a Python script is to use `File -> Execute Python script`. 
This may not be a convenient way to use Python scripts. But there is a simple fix in UE4 
that can't be stored in project files.

1. Go to `Editor Preference` in UE4
2. In `Search details` string type `Python`
3. Tick `Enable Content Browser Integration` flag
4. Restart UE4

Now the Python script shows up in the Content Browser in UE4 just like other assets. 
To run a script, just right-click on it and then choose Run.
